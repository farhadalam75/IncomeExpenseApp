# 🔄 Fixing Data Loss on Deployment

## 🚨 **Problem**
Your data gets deleted on every deployment because SQLite database files are stored in the container's ephemeral storage, which gets destroyed when Railway creates a new container.

## ✅ **Solutions**

### **Option 1: SQLite with Persistent Volume (Current Fix)**

**What I've Changed:**
1. **Database Path**: Changed from `/app/data/` to `/data/` (Railway volume mount)
2. **Railway Config**: Added volume mount in `railway.toml`
3. **Dockerfile**: Updated directory creation

**Files Modified:**
- `Program.cs` - Updated database path
- `Dockerfile` - Changed directory creation
- `railway.toml` - Added volume configuration

**Next Steps:**
1. Commit and push these changes
2. Deploy to Railway
3. Your database will now persist between deployments

### **Option 2: PostgreSQL Database (Recommended for Production)**

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fully managed database
- ✅ Better performance for multiple users
- ✅ Built-in backups
- ✅ Automatic scaling

**To Switch to PostgreSQL:**
1. **Add PostgreSQL to Railway:**
   ```bash
   # In Railway dashboard:
   # 1. Go to your project
   # 2. Click "Add Service" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   # 3. Railway will automatically set DATABASE_URL
   ```

2. **Add Npgsql Package:**
   ```bash
   cd IncomeExpenseApp
   dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
   ```

3. **Replace Program.cs:**
   ```bash
   # Replace current Program.cs with Program-postgres.cs
   cp Program-postgres.cs IncomeExpenseApp/Program.cs
   ```

4. **Update railway.toml:**
   ```bash
   # Replace current railway.toml with railway-postgres.toml
   cp railway-postgres.toml railway.toml
   ```

## 🚀 **Current Status**

Your app is now configured with **SQLite + Persistent Volume**. This means:
- ✅ Data will survive deployments
- ✅ Database file stored in `/data/incomeexpense.db`
- ✅ Volume automatically mounted by Railway

## 📝 **Migration Notes**

**First Deployment After This Fix:**
- Your current data will be lost ONE MORE TIME (because we're moving from ephemeral to persistent storage)
- After this deployment, all future deployments will preserve your data

**Future Deployments:**
- ✅ All transaction data preserved
- ✅ Account balances maintained
- ✅ Settings and categories kept

## 🔧 **Verification**

After deploying, you can verify persistence by:
1. Adding some test data
2. Triggering a new deployment
3. Checking if the data is still there

## 📱 **Railway Volume Details**

Railway automatically:
- Creates a persistent volume
- Mounts it to `/data` in your container
- Preserves data across deployments
- Provides 1GB free storage per project

Your SQLite database will now be safely stored in this persistent volume! 🎉

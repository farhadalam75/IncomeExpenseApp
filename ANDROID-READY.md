# 🎉 Android App - Ready to Build!

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your Income Expense App is now configured with GitHub Actions to automatically build Android APKs!

## 🚀 How to Build Your Android App

### Method 1: GitHub Actions (Easiest - Recommended)

#### Option A: Manual Trigger
1. **Push your changes** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin working-app
   ```

2. **Go to GitHub Actions**:
   - Navigate to: `https://github.com/farhadalam75/IncomeExpenseApp/actions`
   - Click on "Build Android APK" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" dropdown
   - Select `working-app` branch
   - Click green "Run workflow" button

3. **Wait for build** (~5-10 minutes)

4. **Download APK**:
   - Once complete, click on the workflow run
   - Scroll to "Artifacts" section
   - Download `income-expense-app-debug-xxxxx`
   - Extract the ZIP file to get your APK

#### Option B: Create a Release
```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
This will:
- Automatically build the APK
- Create a GitHub Release
- Attach the APK to the release
- You can download from Releases page!

### Method 2: Local Build

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /workspaces/IncomeExpenseApp

# Run the build script
./build-android.sh
```

APK will be at: `IncomeExpenseApp/ClientApp/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## 📱 Install on Your Phone

1. **Download the APK** (from GitHub Actions or local build)
2. **Transfer to phone** (USB, email, Google Drive, etc.)
3. **Enable Unknown Sources**:
   - Settings → Security → Install from Unknown Sources
4. **Tap the APK** and install
5. **Open and enjoy!** 🎊
